# python-api-challenge

 In this project,I analyzed weather trends and vacation tendencies. I used Jupyter Noteboook and Pandas primarily. Discussion about the linear relationship: Based on my analysis of the data, it has become very clear that as you approach the equator, the maximum temperature is going to continue to increase. The further you are from the equator, the colder your temperatures will be!Based on the data visualization I created, there is no correlation between wind speed and latitude. Frankly, both plots looks very similar. No data has been found after analyzing any trends.Based on the models I created with the data set, it is very difficult to tell if there is a correlation, if any, between wind speed and latitude. There are many outliers that make it hard to find a trend.
